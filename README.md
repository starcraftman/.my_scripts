My Scripts
==========

This repo contains some scripts I use.
If anyone else likes them, use them.
Some are very handy, I'll detail them below.

mksource.py 
-----------
* I like to use templates when I write scripts/c, this file copies them.
* See templates folder, some like python maybe should be separated to a notes file...

ycm_compile.py 
--------------
* See my vim directory, this helper function compiles ycm for use.
* YCM requires other things, see vimrc for details.
  
eclipseBackup
--------------
* Folder stores list of plugins I use and my metadata folder.
* Extract that to .metadata in workspace to have settings.

vim_and_bash_config
-------------------
* Stores my .vimrc file for vim config.
* Read it, some plugins require extra steps like vundle/YCM.
* .vim folder has some stuff I don't download with vundle like colors, ftplugin custom files and such.
* .bash_aliases some cool PS1 hacks for git/hg and other assorted bash conveniences.
